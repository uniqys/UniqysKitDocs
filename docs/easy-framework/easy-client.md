# or
$ yarn add @uniqys/easy-client
```

Use [`EasyClientForBrowser`](#easyclientforbrowser) for general DApps development.

const easy = new EasyClient(signer, config)
```

#### Argument

- **signer**: A object necessary for signing. Please refer to `Signer` in `easy-client` package for more details.
- **config**: A instance of `AxiosRequestConfig`. Please refer to [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for more details.

### EasyClient.\<request type\>

## EasyClientForBrowser

`EasyClientForBrowser` is an extended class of `EasyClient`, designed to use during development.
`EasyClientForBrowser` shows alert when user signs a transaction.
By accepting to the alert, the request will be sent with a signature of the user.

::: warning
Using `EasyClientForBrowser` is not safe since it uses browser's localStorage to save users' wallet key.
We do not recommend using it in the product.
An official wallet is not released yet, but when you are developing your own wallet, you should use the `EasyClient` class.
:::

```js
const easy = new EasyClientForBrowser(baseUrl)
```

#### Argument

- **baseUrl**: Base URL for the application.

## EasyClientForWeb3
`EasyClientForWeb3` is an extended class of `EasyClient`, designed to use existing wallets, such as Metamask, Qurag√©, etc. with [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js).

```js
const easy = new EasyClientForWeb3(web3.currentProvider, baseUrl)
```

#### Argument

- **baseUrl**: Base URL for the application.

## Usage via CDN
In path `node_modules/@uniqys/easy-client/lib/easy.js` there is a pre-bundled Easy Client, so you may cast it from the server to use in the client side.
`easy.js` makes instances from the class [`EasyClientForBrowser`](#easyclientforbrowser) as `Browser` and from the class [`EasyClientForWeb3`](#easyclientforweb3) as `Web3`.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/easy.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
const easyBrowser = new Easy.Browser(location.origin) // EasyClientForBrowser
const easyWeb3 = new Easy.Web3(web3.currentProvider, location.origin) // EasyClientForWeb3
...
</script>
```
